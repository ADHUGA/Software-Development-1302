To run this program, you need to first compile all the java files designated at Project2/src/edu/uga/cs1302/Vehicles
You can compile by doing the command javac ./*.java . This command compiles all the files ending in .java
You can choose to put the class files in another directory if you do javac -d if you want. Next you need to set-up your classpath
so you can run the VehicleManager.class file. You can open your .bash_profile in your home directory and edit your classpath there.
Once you do that navigate back to the VehicleManager.class file you created and do java VehicleManager. Once you have done that you will
have successfully ran the program and you can look and compare my vehicles.
