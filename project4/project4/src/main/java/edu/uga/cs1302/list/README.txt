Before you do anything make sure you classpath is set up properly for junit and for running any other files, alternatively you can use the -cp command when using java to bypass this up to you. You can compile my program by first cleaning my project by navigating to the folder where you see pom.xml and typing mvn clean. After you do that you can type mvn compile to compile my project. Then you can do mvn test to run my tester class with junit imported to see how it fairs. That is how to compile and test my project if you did mvn clean and it messed with my JavaDoc comments you can navigate to the folder with pom.xml and type mvn site to create a website documenation of my project. My classes do not have a main method attached to them.
