You can run my program by doing mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=edu.uga.cs1302.quiz.GeographyQuiz. You want to execute this while you are in mobaxterm (and in the project5 directory where the pom.xml is) or you could use PuTTy and x server set up. Once you execute this command my project pops up and there is a help button that tells you what to do. If you want to compile my program, you would use the command mvn complie while in the project5 directory where the pom.xml file is. You would might want to run mvn clean because I am submitting the project with all the class files in them so you can run my project as quickly as possible. I did not package my project if you wish to do so then do mvn package. I figured since you wanted to test the project's code and GUI the first command I had at the top would be enough.
